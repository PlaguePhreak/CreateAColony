"""
Writes the simple placeholder models of the hut blocks (and the Supply Camp and Field marker) to
assets/createacolony/shapes/block/. Each hut is a crate with a few boxes on top that show what the hut is for.
The Town Hall and Farmer's Hut models were made by hand by Aaron's friend and are not written here.
