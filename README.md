# Create a Colony (starter skeleton)

Vintage Story 1.22.x code mod, .NET 10. This is milestone 1 only: found a colony, get a vanilla
land claim, recruit settlers that persist with the save. Compiles cleanly against the 1.22.7 API; not yet tested in-game.

## Build
1. Install the .NET 10 SDK and set `VINTAGE_STORY` to your game folder.
2. Run `dotnet build CreateAColony.csproj -c Release`.
3. The ready-to-install mod is written to `Releases/createacolony_<version>.zip`. Copy that zip into the
   game's `Mods` folder.

## Try it
- Place a **Town Hall** (creative inventory): founds the colony, claims a 49x49 area, and 3 to 4 settlers arrive.
- `/colony info` inside the claim shows the colony.
- `/colony invite <player>`, then that player types `/colony join`. `/colony leave` leaves the colony you stand in.
- `/colony recruit [name]` (needs controlserver) spawns one more settler, for testing.
- Craft a **Supply Camp** (3 firewood over 2 sticks) and place it inside your colony. Right-click once per in-game day for starter materials, 5 deliveries per colony. Edit `assets/createacolony/config/supplycamp.json` to change the bundle.
- Breaking the Town Hall disbands the colony and removes the claim.
- The mod refuses to start if VS Village is installed.

## Config (`ModConfig/createacolony.json`)
- `Permadeath` (default `true`): settlers who die are gone. Set `false` to have them knocked out and recover after `DownedRecoveryDays`.
- `StartingSettlersMin` / `StartingSettlersMax` (default 3 / 4).

## Layout
- `src/CreateAColonyModSystem.cs` registration, VS Village guard, commands
- `src/ColonyConfig.cs` server config
- `src/Colonies/` Colony data (protobuf) and `ColonyManager` (save/load, claims, members)
- `src/Settlers/` `EntitySettler` and the `colonycitizen` behavior
- `src/Block/` Town Hall block and block entity
- `assets/createacolony/` entity, block and lang JSON

## Known TODOs
- Town Hall and Supply Camp use a plain plank-cube look for now.
- Respawn of lost settlers, the Town Hall GUI, and job tasks are milestone 2+.
